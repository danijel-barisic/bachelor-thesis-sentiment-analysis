# Sentiment analysis applied to movie reviews using neuroevolution

Summary:
Sentiment analysis is done on IMDB movie review dataset. LSTM neural network is built,
and serves to evaluate individual potential solutions. Evolutionary algorithm is tasked with
maintaining and evolving a population of potential solutions. Solutions are evaluated
through processes inspired by nature, like selection, mutation, crossover and fitness of units
within the population.
